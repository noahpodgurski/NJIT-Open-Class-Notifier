# NJIT-Open-Class-Notifier
Sends you email when there is a spot open in a section(s) of your choosing

1. You will need to create a dummy gmail account with `high security authentification` turned off for this to work.
2. Run the program and type in which classes and sections you would like to be alerted for. You can choose multiple classes and sections within the same class.

Note: This program does not take into account waitlists, often, there will be false positives, as there will be a "spot" open when really it is for the waitlisted person. I find this program works best when NJIT disables the waitlists, you can often grab each and every class you need.
